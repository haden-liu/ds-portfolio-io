I am a Sydney-based Junior Data Scientist with strong skills in SQL and Python, as well as analytical and predictive modelling. In addition, I have over five years professional experience in the logistics and supply chain industry.

Data science appeals to me as it is a way to contribute to the sustainability in business and obtain insights to various industries. A key competency I have gained from undertaking the Data Science immersive course at General Assembly is learning how to provide valuable insights to stakeholders from using the datasets with EDA and testing. Specifically, I am looking for a data analyst role where I can utilise my skills and experiences to assist with the business decision making process.
